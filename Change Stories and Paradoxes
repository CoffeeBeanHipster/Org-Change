 
 """ Tensions are normal when we must undergo change. 
We see this with aching muscles, growing pains, emotional hardships, 
as well as within the structures of our companies. 

Individual stories are distinctive. If enough are collected,
you've got a data set (this is reductive, but more on that later). 

While change management has levels of structure to be successful,
the stories of change give us a sense of shared understanding --
a way of empathizing and rationalizing a change, 

so that we don't have to be afraid of it.

Let's learn what to look for as our change stories unfold.

Stories have characters, which are played by a personification
of who we see as the plot continues. These are the people directly
involved in and affected by the change we want to implement.

These characters all make decisions as the change is happening.
These decisions then each create branch points where 
different outcomes occur. 

There is a main plot: the problem we want to solve.

There are consequences to the decisions the actors make 
as the story is told.

Which eventually tells us why an outcome happened. This is our explanation.

The decision tree that covers our plot are our process narratives. 

This approach to change management has advantages over the purely statistical:
  - We see the forest AND the trees. Provides a frame of reference
  - Complex events are broken down step by step with event sequencing
  - Relationship of factors on the event outcomes
  - Narrative patterns begin to form as more stories are told
  
 The background events like the mechanisms and understandings of how 
 events happen in the plot become our process theories. 
 
 This concept of providing a frame of reference to understand change 
 through the stories that are told is called narrative knowing (Palmer et al., 2022).
